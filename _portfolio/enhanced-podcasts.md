Enhanced podcasts offer a rich user interface that bring a whole host of new features. You can navigate by topic or using a transcript, view relevant charts and images, follow related links, view contributor profiles, and share clips.

This project stemmed from a need to better understand what data we should generate during production. As we upgrade our production systems to use IP technology, we unlock new opportunities to collect and store much more information as part of the production process. For example, by labelling microphones with people’s identity, we can tag who is speaking, and when, on a recording.

We are also working on technology that can automatically extract much more information from audio recordings. Our work on speech-to-text, for example, has already made it easier to search through archives of speech recordings. There is a variety of potential routes for this research, but without a solid understanding of what data we want to generate and why, it is difficult to know where we focus our efforts.

This is where our prototype player comes in. By gaining a better understanding of what information and interaction features our audience value most, we can target our research to enable us to deliver those experiences on a large scale.

There have been a few previous attempts to use data to enhance podcast listening. In early 2018, The Guardian’s Mobile Innovation Lab released a special player for their podcast “Strange Bird”. Their player featured a chat-like interface that popped up with related visualisations, images and links. It also used push notifications to alert mobile phone users to new content.

At BBC R&D, our research into prototyping news formats produced a player called “FastForward”. This allowed listeners to scroll using a transcript, and a timeline that segmented the programme by speaker.
