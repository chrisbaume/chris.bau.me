<p>
Snug helps you or your baby fall into a deep sleep using soothing and calming sounds. Its unique monitor feature detects when your baby cries and helps them back to sleep. The timer slowly fades down the sound after a set duration. It can even use your phoneâ€™s screen to provide soft mood lighting.
